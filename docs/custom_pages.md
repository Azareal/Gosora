# Custom Pages

There are two ways to create custom pages in Gosora, one which requires a lot more technical knowledge than the other. The first is to create the page via the Page Manager in the Control Panel where you'll be able to type whatever you want visible on the page into a little form.

The second is to create a template file in /pages/ which will be loaded by Gosora and parsed like any template will. You will require knowledge of HTML, and possibly even Go Templates for this option, but it's a lot more flexible than the first option.

More to come.
