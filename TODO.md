# TO-DO

Oh my, you caught me right at the start of this project. There's nothing to see here yet, asides from the absolute basics. You might want to look again later!


The various little features which somehow got stuck in the net. Don't worry, I'll get to them!

More moderation features. E.g. Move, Approval Queue (Posts made by users in certain usergroups will need to be approved by a moderator before they're publically visible), etc.

Add a simple anti-spam measure. I have quite a few ideas in mind, but it'll take a while to implement the more advanced ones, so I'd like to put off some of those to a later date and focus on the basics. E.g. CAPTCHAs, hidden fields, etc.

Add more granular permissions management to the Forum Manager.

Add a *better* plugin system. E.g. Allow for plugins written in Javascript and ones written in Go. Also, we need to add many, many, many more plugin hooks.

I will need to ponder over implementing an even faster router. We don't need one immediately, although it would be nice if we could get one in the near future. It really depends. Ideally, it would be one which can easily integrate with the current structure without much work, although I'm not beyond making some alterations to faciliate it, assuming that we don't get too tightly bound to that specific router.

Allow themes to define their own templates and to override core templates with their own.

Add a friend system.

Improve profile customisability.

Implement all the common BBCode tags in plugin_bbcode

Implement all the common Markdown codes in plugin_markdown

Add more administration features.

Add more features for improving user engagement. E.g. A like system. I have a few of these in mind, but I've been pre-occupied with implementing other features.

Add a widget system.

Add support for multi-factor authentication.

Add support for secondary emails for users.

Improve the shell scripts and possibly add support for Make? A make.go might be a good solution?
